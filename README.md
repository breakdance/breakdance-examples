# What is this?

This repository hosts examples of the markdown generated by [breakdance](http://breakdance.io/index.html), to help you get an idea of what breakdance does, and what to expect when using it.

## Examples

### commonmark spec HTML

- [commonmark/breakdance-example-commonmark.html](commonmark/breakdance-example-commonmark.html): This is the HTML we're going to convert. For this, I used the HTML from Version 0.27 (2016-11-18) of the [commonmark specification](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.27/), which is nearly 13,000 lines of code.
- [commonmark/breakdance-example-commonmark.md](commonmark/breakdance-example-commonmark.md): The markdown generated by breakdance (from `breakdance-example-commonmark.html`)
- [commonmark/breakdance-example-commonmark.txt](commonmark/breakdance-example-commonmark.txt): Same as `breakdance-example-commonmark.md`, but in plain text, so you can see the actual unrendered-markdown
